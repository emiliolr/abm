This is all of the code for implementations of the **classic majority rule** and **influence majority rule** agent-based models in Python using `Mesa`. All dependencies are included in `requirements.txt`.

To run the interactive visualization, use the `mesa runserver` command line command in this directory. From there, a tab should open in your browser where you can interact with the models.
