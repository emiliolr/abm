1. [Getting started with R](getting_started_w_r.html) - this exercise includes basic plotting with Base R and `ggplot`.
2. [Plotting geospatial data](plotting_geospatial_data.html) - this exercise is focused on reading in shape data using `sf` and plotting with `ggplot`.
3. [Plotting population data](plotting_population_data.html) - this exercise works on aggregating population data from a raster to different administrative boundaries.
4. [Population description](population_description.html) - this exercise is an extension of the previous three exercises, with a more thorough description of the population features of Eswatini.
5. [Description of de facto settlements](description_of_settlements.html) - this exercise works to isolate the populous regions of Mkhiweni, a tinkhundla of the Manzini region, as a way of describing some of the de facto human settlements in Eswatini.
6. [Adding road networks and healthcare facilities](roads_and_healthcare.html) - this exercise begins to look at additional infrastructure and service elements, serving as the first steps towards quantifying accessibility in Mkhiweni.
7. [Data Science Insight 1](DS_insight_1.html) - a brief introduction to the Tidyverts, a meta package used for time series analysis and forecasting in R.
8. [Project 1](project_1.html) - a write up that summarizes elements from the previous few exercises, providing additional analysis along the way.
9. [Project 2 Outline](project_2_outline.html) - a short summary of my plans for Project 2.
10. [Data Science Insight 2](DS_insight_2.html) - a quick look at innovations in Twitter geolocation using CNNs.
11. [Project 2](project_2_writeup.html) - a write up discussing the methods that were applied to produce a synthetic population for Eswatini.
12. [Data Science Insight 3](DS_insight_3.html) - a whirlwind tour of GANs, several miscellaneous applications, and advances in applications to geospatial analysis.
13. [Data Science Knowledge Creation](DS_knowledge_creation.html) - a reflection on the themes from this course.
14. [Project 3](project_3_writeup.html) - a writeup up exploring the gravity model of human migration and its potential uses in predicting agent flows in Eswatini.
